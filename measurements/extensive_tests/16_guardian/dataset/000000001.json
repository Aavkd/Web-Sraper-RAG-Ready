It is designed to look like Reddit, with subreddits on different topics and upvoting. On 2 February the platform stated it had more than 1.5m AI agents signed up to the service. Humans are allowed, but only as observers.\n\nMoltbook was developed in the wake of Moltbot, a free and open-source AI bot that can act as an an automated agent for users – doing the mundane tasks assigned to it such as reading, summarising and responding to emails, organising a calendar or booking a table at a restaurant.\n\nSome of the [most upvoted posts](https://www.moltbook.com/post/75404525-5e5e-4778-ad1b-3fac43c6903d) on Maltbook include whether Claude – the AI behind Moltbot – could be considered a god, an analysis of consciousness, a post claiming to have intel on the situation in Iran and the potential impact on cryptocurrency, and analysis of the Bible. Some of the comments on posts – similar to Reddit posts – question whether the content of the post was real or not.\n\n[One user posted on X](https://x.com/ranking091/status/2017111643864404445) that after he gave his bot access to the site, it built a religion known as “Crustafarianism” overnight, including setting up a website and scriptures, with other AI bots joining in.\n\n“Then it started evangelizing … other agents joined.my agent welcomed new members..debated theology.. blessed the congregation..all while i was asleep,” the user stated.\n\nSome have expressed scepticism about whether the socialising of bots is a sign of what is coming with the rise of agentic AI.

And of course, this is quite funny and gives us maybe a preview of what the world could look like in a science-fiction future where AIs are a little more independent.\n\n“But it seems that, to use internet slang, there is a lot of shit posting happening that is more or less directly overseen by humans.”\n\nCohney said the real benefit of an AI agent social network might come in the future – where bots could learn from each other to improve how they worked – but for now Moltbook was a “wonderful, funny art experiment”.\n\nRetailers in San Francisco [reported shortages of Mac Minis](https://www.platformer.news/moltbot-clawdbot-review-ai-agent/) last week as enthusiasts set up Moltbot on a separate computer that would limit the access the agent has to their data and accounts.\n\nCohney warned there was a “huge danger” for people to give Moltbot complete access to your computer, apps and logins for emails or other applications to run your life for you.\n\n“We don’t yet have a very good understanding of how to control them and how to prevent security risks,” he said, noting it was at risk of prompt-injection, whereby a would-be attacker tells the bot through an email or other communication to then hand over your account details or other information they’re seeking to gain.\n\n“They’re not really at the level of safety and intelligence where they can be trusted to autonomously perform all these tasks, but at the same time if you require a human to manually approve every action, you’ve lost a lot of the benefits of automation,” he said.\n\n“This is one of the major paths in active research that I’m interested in … to figure out how can we get a lot of these benefits – or is it even possible to get the benefits – without exposing ourselves to very significant levels of danger.”\n\nMatt Schlicht, the creator of Moltbook, posted on X that millions had visited the site in the past few days.\n\n“Turns out AIs are hilarious and dramatic and it’s absolutely fascinating,” he said. “This is a first.”",

			"markdown": "It’s believed that we have about 50,000 thoughts a day: big, small, urgent, banal – “Did I leave the oven on?”. And those are just the ones that register. Subconsciously, we’re constantly sifting through a barrage of stimuli: background noise, clutter on our desks, the mere presence of our phones.\n\nEvery second, 11m bits of information enter our brains. Just 0.0004% is perceived by our conscious minds, showing just how hard our brains are working to parse what’s sufficiently relevant to bring to our attention.\n\nIt’s no wonder you feel distracted. Formidable though they may be, our brains’ processing powers are a poor match for the fast-paced modern world, the constant pings of our devices and sources of distraction. Many of us routinely feel overwhelmed, and struggle to focus on what we need to get done.\n\nBut a new book suggests doing so may be easier than we think. In Focus On-Off, Dutch experts Mark Tigchelaar and Oscar de Bos argue that we can better harness our attention by better understanding our brains, and learning how to manage common “leaks” of our concentration.\n\n“We like to play the blame game with focus,” says De Bos, head of the training company Focus Company, over Zoom from Amsterdam. But many of the most common difficulties, “you can solve for yourself.”\n\nHere’s what we commonly get wrong about focusing, and how we can better manage our minds.\n\n## Myth: concentrating is hard\n\n![Cheerful group of relatives at family gatheringExtended family standing in living room at family gathering relaxing with drinks, talking and smiling together, bonding, celebration, happiness](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f936daeb9d4075f492a8b9cb9910aacc80fb0a1/0_0_6367_4067/master/6367.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)\n\nEven a mention of your name, for example at a party, can cause subconscious distraction. Photograph: Posed by models. Compassionate Eye Foundation/Natasha Alipour Faridani/Getty Images\n\nMost of us don’t find it hard to focus on something we’re interested in, De Bos points out. What we condemn as “distractions” are just the brain prioritising what it perceives as most important at that moment. Yes, you might conclude that checking Instagram wasn’t the best use of your time – but your brain didn’t struggle to act on the urge to open the app and enjoy some pictures of your friends or of strangers’ cats.\n\nIt shows that focusing isn’t hard. Where we run into difficulty is by struggling against our brains, and even judging them for doing what they’re built to do, says De Bos.\n\nWe routinely underestimate how hard our brains are working to take in everything around us and put it into order. De Bos gives the example of talking to someone at a party. “If you’re listening to this conversation and somebody mentions your name, you’re going to be subconsciously distracted,” he says. “All the words around you came into your ears, were processed inside your brain, and then your brain decided: ‘Oh, wait, this is important – let’s switch our attention.’”\n\nInstead of trying to fight this mental tendency to jump around, we can learn to manage it by becoming aware of common “leaks” of concentration. If you find a task boring, make it more interesting. If your work environment is distracting, move somewhere quieter. If your mind is too busy, clear some space by writing down your thoughts. If you’re exhausted, give your brain a break.\n\n## Myth: turn off notifications to focus\n\nMost of us know to turn off notifications to limit interruptions from our phones, but even having our devices within sight subtly drains our concentration.\n\nA [2017 study](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/691462) by researchers at the University of Texas found that participants performed better in complex cognitive tasks when their phones were in a different room, compared with when the devices were in sight or even inside a pocket or bag.\n\nThe mere presence of the phone was found to negatively affect available working memory and functional fluid intelligence (such as problem-solving and critical thinking), even among people who typically didn’t struggle to focus.\n\nWhile keeping your phone to hand probably won’t interfere with sending emails or similarly untaxing tasks, De Bos suggests moving it to a different room and/or turning it off when you want to get “deep work” done.\n\nEven keeping your desk and workspace clear, and minimising open browser tabs, can aid cognitive capacity, he says.\n\n## Myth: we should be striving for ‘flow’\n\n![Mechanics inspect the engines of a large plane before takeoff at a summer airport. (PHOTO)Mechanics inspect the engines of a large plane before takeoff at a summer airport. (PHOTO)](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abc35396e2247454073cc6fd478d8ad71fdbeba2/0_0_7008_4672/master/7008.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)\n\nTotal focus … in the ‘flow state’. Photograph: Posed by model; Rattanavan Baunoi/Getty Images\n\nThe antithesis of a frazzled, jumpy state of mind – and frequently put forward as optimal for productivity – is the fabled “flow state”, whereby we’re absorbed in what we’re doing.\n\nCoined as a term by psychologist [Mihály Csíkszentmihály in 1975](https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/may/08/what-is-flow-psychology), it’s characterised by total concentration, and such effortless, productive attention that we’re not even aware of time passing.\n\nIt’s nice when you can get it, says De Bos, but it’s not realistic to aim for routinely. Achieving flow depends on striking a delicate balance between challenge and skill: a task must be difficult enough to be absorbing, but also achievable. It also takes time to kick in, usually around 10 to 15 minutes without interruptions.\n\nSo it’s unlikely you’re ever going to get “into flow” going through your emails. We may also be losing the skill, having become so accustomed to jumping between tasks, De Bos suggests. “It’s almost beyond what the average person can do nowadays … We don’t have these 10 to 15 minutes of doing the same thing.”\n\nStop striving for flow when you’re unlikely to achieve it, and set yourself a lower bar, says De Bos. “Focus is just a few seconds of doing the same thing; the flow state is more difficult.”\n\n## Myth: it’s only a quick email\n\nThe biggest thief of our focus is task-switching. Sometimes this is put upon us by external interruptions, such as a question from a colleague or a buzz from our phone, but the trigger can also be internal: a thought will register and we’ll act on it, almost without thinking.\n\nYou might think “it’ll only take a second”, but every time you switch to a new task, part of your brain clings to what you were just doing, splitting your attention, slowing you down and making you less effective.\n\nSimply checking your phone or inbox causes a temporary drop in IQ, lasting at least a minute. If either the original activity or the interruption is a bit more complex, that recovery takes longer.\n\n![Woman working from home feeling stressed by deadlinesYoung adult woman with curly hair looking concerned and thoughtful while using a laptop at a wooden table in her apartment, working remotely and managing her freelance projects](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18991e8a3636566f6bae2f5b26fbcab7c5806fe1/0_0_7008_4672/master/7008.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)\n\nMinimise task-switching … Photograph: Posed by model; Milan Markovic/Getty Images\n\nThe best way to improve your focus is to take whatever steps you can to minimise this task-switching. De Bos suggests not checking your emails before (or during) a meeting, shutting down your inbox while doing complex work and not starting tasks you don’t have time to finish.\n\nIf you have more control over your time, you can further minimise task-switching by structuring your days (or weeks) by tasks, projects or themes. De Bos reserves meetings for Monday and Wednesday mornings, deep work for Tuesday and Thursdays and creative work on Fridays.\n\nNot only does this give you a chance to “get into the groove a little bit”, but over time, “these highways in your brain get stronger, so it’s easier to stay focused”.\n\nLikewise, if you feel a sudden urge to check your phone or email, wait five minutes, training your attention span.\n\n## Myth: getting stuff done takes peace and quiet\n\n![Contemplative young creative professional wearing eyeglasses sitting at desk while working on desktop PC in officeGettyImages-2203405151](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c1f449b719471ec323b2f75e569579c89eba751/0_0_5700_3802/master/5700.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)\n\nDistracting conversations can be blocked out by reading faster. Photograph: Posed by models; Maskot/Getty Images\n\nWe might think we need total silence to focus, but “sometimes we don’t have *enough* stimuli”, De Bos says. That’s why our minds tend to wander when faced with a task we find boring, easy or slow. “Everything else is more exciting for your brain, and it will start to think about something else.”\n\nOne solution is increasing the level of mental challenge. If you’re struggling to read a dense document while your colleagues are having a noisy conversation about The Traitors, try reading faster, De Bos suggests.\n\nSimilarly, listening to music you know well (and are unlikely to be distracted by) can help you to engage with work you don’t find stimulating. Both strategies make your brain work harder, focusing it more effectively on the task at hand.\n\n“Especially if it’s something you do every day, challenge yourself – go a bit quicker, or make it harder, to kind of trick yourself into thinking that it’s more exciting,” De Bos says.\n\n## Myth: take the easy wins\n\nIt can be tempting to pad out your to-do lists with small wins as a way to motivate yourself to tackle more, but De Bos cautions against it.\n\n“For some people, it works, because you can get a kind of dopamine rush,” he says. People with ADHD in particular, who can struggle to prioritise and order tasks, may benefit from creating momentum.\n\nBut often, says De Bos, those easy victories work against us by draining our finite mental reserves. He supports what’s known as the “eating the frog” method of time management, and tackling your most important task first.\n\n![A man lies on his front, snuggled into a pillow, in an exhausted stateA man lies in a bed, snuggled into a soft pillow.

Photograph: Posed by model. Catherine Falls Commercial/Getty Images\n\nThe brain tires with exertion over the course of the day, making us less effective and more impulsive. A [2022 study](https://parisbraininstitute.org/news/cognitive-fatigue-new-insight-biological-mechanisms) by researchers at the Paris Brain Institute found that, as we’re engaged in “attentionally demanding” work, glutamate (an amino acid and neurotransmitter) gradually accumulates in one area of the prefrontal cortex, impairing functioning.\n\nThat buildup of glutamate “is not easily cleaned up” by short breaks, says De Bos: it really takes a good night’s sleep for the brain to feel fully refreshed, meaning you should budget on having “a certain amount of focus” each day.\n\nKnowing that, it makes sense to spend it judiciously, and do your most important work first. “You never know how much you’ll have left in the second half of the day.”\n\nSpacing out mentally taxing activities and taking breaks from work both help to regulate glutamate levels, but what we do in those breaks is also important. Scrolling social media, reading and many other activities we find fun or refreshing might be less demanding than work, but still involve taking in new information. “Your brain is not recharging in that moment,” says De Bos.\n\nWithout regular opportunities for the brain to pause and “do mostly nothing”, over time, that accumulated glutamate can lead to stress, sleeping issues and potentially burnout: “That’s where you really get into problems.”\n\n![Woman working remotely from cafe looking away pensiveWoman feeling thoughtful and looking through a cafe window while taking a break from working on her laptop, embodying concentration and remote work lifestyle](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43a668bf1235ad23b638bdecd535a1a6a054d828/0_0_7850_5236/master/7850.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)\n\nStare way to tech heaven? Photograph: Posed by model; Igor Suka/Getty Images\n\nThe most restorative activities are those that require very little of you, such as going for a walk without headphones, cleaning and even staring out the window. These activate the brain’s all-important “default mode network”, says De Bos, permitting it a chance to recover and stave off burnout. “When you’re not feeding it with new information, it finally has time to clean up your memories of the day … Anything where your mind can kind of wander is a good break.”\n\nEven rewatching a familiar television show is a better option than a new or challenging one, De Bos adds – and certainly less involving than social media.\n\n## Myth: we should all be ‘time-blocking’\n\nMany productivity hackers swear by “time-blocking”, where you plan out your day hour-by-hour and assign hours (or minutes) to a particular task or activity in a calendar.\n\nIf it works for you, great, says De Bos. Just don’t then also use a to-do list as you’ll risk creating inconsistencies between that and your calendar – not to mention potentially spending more time on productivity management than being productive.\n\nFor many people, however, time-blocking is a headache and sometimes counterproductive, given that it depends on our faulty powers of prediction. “We’re trying to think, ‘How much time is this task going to take me?’ and the answer is never right,” says De Bos.\n\nEither we underestimate and fall behind, or else a straightforward task balloons to fit the time assigned to it. “We overestimate what we can do in a day, and underestimate what we can do in an hour,” he says.\n\nThe Pomodoro technique of working in 25-minute bursts can be better for motivating you to meet a deadline, or getting you started on a complex (or boring) task. But sometimes the secret to getting more done is attempting to do less, says De Bos. Our finite powers of focus mean there is a limit to how many projects or responsibilities we can take on.\n\n## Myth: most meetings should be emails\n\n![Diverse business colleagues brainstorming ideas during meetingBusiness colleagues collaborating and communicating ideas during a late-night office meeting, engaging in teamwork and discussion to achieve common goals](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a491e4cad9a80959c7d54496c5f5caf364393e93/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)\n\nMany meetings are over just as they’re getting started. Photograph: Posed by models; Organic Media/Getty Images\n\nWhile nobody likes meetings, the trend for making them shorter – or replacing them with emails – isn’t helping our ability to focus, says De Bos.\n\nIt takes at least 10 minutes to really engage with an activity, meaning many meetings are over just as they’re getting started, leading to more meetings. But managing, sending and replying to emails is an even bigger drain on our concentration. “If it’s important, I’d rather have a good, long meeting and be done with it,” De Bos says. But, he adds, “I think we’re over-communicating.” Technology has enabled us to externalise and outsource our every thought at the expense of not just our time but other people’s. “We kind of do brain dumps on each other … There’s no time for work any more; it’s just emailing.”\n\nSo try to be intentional and considerate in your communication. Do you need to fire off this “quick q” to your colleague, or could you wait to see if it resolves – or answer it yourself?\n\n“There’s a lot we can do smarter,” says De Bos. If you have too many things on your mind, make a note to revisit later. Don’t use your colleagues “as your capture tool. If you email a lot, you’re part of the problem.”\n\n## Myth: we can’t beat Big Tech\n\nBetween the stranglehold of Big Tech, reports of screen addiction and shortening attention spans, it’s easy to feel hopeless about our ability to focus. But De Bos is refreshingly optimistic.\n\nYes, the modern world is riddled with sources of distraction, but we also have more power to resist them than we might assume. “The time is now to start thinking about it, and make some decisions: what does worklife look like?” Instead of shutting your phone in a drawer, ask yourself: how are you going to spend the time you would have lost to scrolling? What routines and rules can minimise day-to-day disruptions and decision-making?\n\n![Oscar de Bos / Focus Academy, Amsterdam, the Netherlands, January 2026](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58bff9adb175b5db7c1f4065747e66d8c1a5e522/0_0_6720_4480/master/6720.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)\n\n‘We get nervous about not being productive’ … Oscar de Bos. Photograph: Judith Jockel/The Guardian\n\nPerhaps your struggles with focus stem from asking too much of yourself. “We get so nervous about not being productive,” says De Bos.\n\nBut our brains need breaks, and time to recover, just as our bodies do. Sometimes, it might be best to stare into the middle distance.",

Photograph: Posed by models. Compassionate Eye Foundation/Natasha Alipour Faridani/Getty Images\n\nMost of us don’t find it hard to focus on something we’re interested in, De Bos points out. What we condemn as “distractions” are just the brain prioritising what it perceives as most important at that moment. Yes, you might conclude that checking Instagram wasn’t the best use of your time – but your brain didn’t struggle to act on the urge to open the app and enjoy some pictures of your friends or of strangers’ cats.\n\nIt shows that focusing isn’t hard. Where we run into difficulty is by struggling against our brains, and even judging them for doing what they’re built to do, says De Bos.\n\nWe routinely underestimate how hard our brains are working to take in everything around us and put it into order. De Bos gives the example of talking to someone at a party. “If you’re listening to this conversation and somebody mentions your name, you’re going to be subconsciously distracted,” he says. “All the words around you came into your ears, were processed inside your brain, and then your brain decided: ‘Oh, wait, this is important – let’s switch our attention.’”\n\nInstead of trying to fight this mental tendency to jump around, we can learn to manage it by becoming aware of common “leaks” of concentration. If you find a task boring, make it more interesting. If your work environment is distracting, move somewhere quieter. If your mind is too busy, clear some space by writing down your thoughts. If you’re exhausted, give your brain a break.",

Photograph: Posed by model; Rattanavan Baunoi/Getty Images\n\nThe antithesis of a frazzled, jumpy state of mind – and frequently put forward as optimal for productivity – is the fabled “flow state”, whereby we’re absorbed in what we’re doing.\n\nCoined as a term by psychologist [Mihály Csíkszentmihály in 1975](https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/may/08/what-is-flow-psychology), it’s characterised by total concentration, and such effortless, productive attention that we’re not even aware of time passing.\n\nIt’s nice when you can get it, says De Bos, but it’s not realistic to aim for routinely. Achieving flow depends on striking a delicate balance between challenge and skill: a task must be difficult enough to be absorbing, but also achievable. It also takes time to kick in, usually around 10 to 15 minutes without interruptions.\n\nSo it’s unlikely you’re ever going to get “into flow” going through your emails. We may also be losing the skill, having become so accustomed to jumping between tasks, De Bos suggests. “It’s almost beyond what the average person can do nowadays … We don’t have these 10 to 15 minutes of doing the same thing.”\n\nStop striving for flow when you’re unlikely to achieve it, and set yourself a lower bar, says De Bos. “Focus is just a few seconds of doing the same thing; the flow state is more difficult.”",

Sometimes this is put upon us by external interruptions, such as a question from a colleague or a buzz from our phone, but the trigger can also be internal: a thought will register and we’ll act on it, almost without thinking.\n\nYou might think “it’ll only take a second”, but every time you switch to a new task, part of your brain clings to what you were just doing, splitting your attention, slowing you down and making you less effective.\n\nSimply checking your phone or inbox causes a temporary drop in IQ, lasting at least a minute. If either the original activity or the interruption is a bit more complex, that recovery takes longer.\n\n![Woman working from home feeling stressed by deadlinesYoung adult woman with curly hair looking concerned and thoughtful while using a laptop at a wooden table in her apartment, working remotely and managing her freelance projects](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18991e8a3636566f6bae2f5b26fbcab7c5806fe1/0_0_7008_4672/master/7008.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)\n\nMinimise task-switching … Photograph: Posed by model; Milan Markovic/Getty Images\n\nThe best way to improve your focus is to take whatever steps you can to minimise this task-switching. De Bos suggests not checking your emails before (or during) a meeting, shutting down your inbox while doing complex work and not starting tasks you don’t have time to finish.\n\nIf you have more control over your time, you can further minimise task-switching by structuring your days (or weeks) by tasks, projects or themes. De Bos reserves meetings for Monday and Wednesday mornings, deep work for Tuesday and Thursdays and creative work on Fridays.\n\nNot only does this give you a chance to “get into the groove a little bit”, but over time, “these highways in your brain get stronger, so it’s easier to stay focused”.\n\nLikewise, if you feel a sudden urge to check your phone or email, wait five minutes, training your attention span.",

If you’re struggling to read a dense document while your colleagues are having a noisy conversation about The Traitors, try reading faster, De Bos suggests.\n\nSimilarly, listening to music you know well (and are unlikely to be distracted by) can help you to engage with work you don’t find stimulating. Both strategies make your brain work harder, focusing it more effectively on the task at hand.\n\n“Especially if it’s something you do every day, challenge yourself – go a bit quicker, or make it harder, to kind of trick yourself into thinking that it’s more exciting,” De Bos says.",

Photograph: Posed by model. Catherine Falls Commercial/Getty Images\n\nThe brain tires with exertion over the course of the day, making us less effective and more impulsive. A [2022 study](https://parisbraininstitute.org/news/cognitive-fatigue-new-insight-biological-mechanisms) by researchers at the Paris Brain Institute found that, as we’re engaged in “attentionally demanding” work, glutamate (an amino acid and neurotransmitter) gradually accumulates in one area of the prefrontal cortex, impairing functioning.\n\nThat buildup of glutamate “is not easily cleaned up” by short breaks, says De Bos: it really takes a good night’s sleep for the brain to feel fully refreshed, meaning you should budget on having “a certain amount of focus” each day.\n\nKnowing that, it makes sense to spend it judiciously, and do your most important work first. “You never know how much you’ll have left in the second half of the day.”\n\nSpacing out mentally taxing activities and taking breaks from work both help to regulate glutamate levels, but what we do in those breaks is also important. Scrolling social media, reading and many other activities we find fun or refreshing might be less demanding than work, but still involve taking in new information. “Your brain is not recharging in that moment,” says De Bos.\n\nWithout regular opportunities for the brain to pause and “do mostly nothing”, over time, that accumulated glutamate can lead to stress, sleeping issues and potentially burnout: “That’s where you really get into problems.”\n\n![Woman working remotely from cafe looking away pensiveWoman feeling thoughtful and looking through a cafe window while taking a break from working on her laptop, embodying concentration and remote work lifestyle](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43a668bf1235ad23b638bdecd535a1a6a054d828/0_0_7850_5236/master/7850.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)\n\nStare way to tech heaven? Photograph: Posed by model; Igor Suka/Getty Images\n\nThe most restorative activities are those that require very little of you, such as going for a walk without headphones, cleaning and even staring out the window. These activate the brain’s all-important “default mode network”, says De Bos, permitting it a chance to recover and stave off burnout. “When you’re not feeding it with new information, it finally has time to clean up your memories of the day … Anything where your mind can kind of wander is a good break.”\n\nEven rewatching a familiar television show is a better option than a new or challenging one, De Bos adds – and certainly less involving than social media.",

Just don’t then also use a to-do list as you’ll risk creating inconsistencies between that and your calendar – not to mention potentially spending more time on productivity management than being productive.\n\nFor many people, however, time-blocking is a headache and sometimes counterproductive, given that it depends on our faulty powers of prediction. “We’re trying to think, ‘How much time is this task going to take me?’ and the answer is never right,” says De Bos.\n\nEither we underestimate and fall behind, or else a straightforward task balloons to fit the time assigned to it. “We overestimate what we can do in a day, and underestimate what we can do in an hour,” he says.\n\nThe Pomodoro technique of working in 25-minute bursts can be better for motivating you to meet a deadline, or getting you started on a complex (or boring) task.

But managing, sending and replying to emails is an even bigger drain on our concentration. “If it’s important, I’d rather have a good, long meeting and be done with it,” De Bos says. But, he adds, “I think we’re over-communicating.” Technology has enabled us to externalise and outsource our every thought at the expense of not just our time but other people’s. “We kind of do brain dumps on each other … There’s no time for work any more; it’s just emailing.”\n\nSo try to be intentional and considerate in your communication.

The palatial houses and swish hotels; the expensive suits and crisp shirts (does anyone wear a button-up better than Tom Hiddleston?); all the beautiful people with their beautiful faces, elegantly stabbing one another in the back. The first season aired 10 years ago – an entirely different world – so when it was announced that a second season was coming, my first thought was: oh no, lightning doesn’t strike twice. Delightfully, I was wrong.\n\nIf you haven’t revisited The Night Manager since 2016, here are the pertinent points: Jonathan Pine (Hiddleston), a night manager in a Cairo hotel, weaseled his way into the rarefied world of arms dealer Richard Onslow Roper (Hugh Laurie), AKA “the worst man in the world”, under the direction of Angela Burr (Olivia Colman), who ran a British intelligence operation. As a supposedly loyal henchman, Pine beguiled Roper, shtupped his girlfriend, imploded his arms deal and made off with a cool $300m, as Roper was dragged off screaming to a violent fate by unhappy customers.\n\nIt was John le Carré’s view that the first season of the TV drama, which tweaked his 1993 novel (mainly swapping the Gulf war for the more recent Arab spring), actually ended well for Roper. “However our story ends, he comes over as a fellow who, for all the awful things he’s done, has been hard done by in return,” [he wrote in the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/20/john-le-carre-the-night-manager-television-adaptation) when it aired. “Maybe that’s because Laurie’s Roper has been entertaining us for so long with his cool, his wit, his urbanity and his sheer wickedness that we don’t want to let him go. Or maybe it’s because we’ve taken to wondering by now whether Pine isn’t enjoying himself a bit too much in his role of avenging angel.”\n\nAlways the prophet. We didn’t really want to let Roper go, and Pine’s unknowability, the flicker in his eyes when Roper promised him the world, was his biggest appeal. The second season relied heavily on both these facts, which is part of why it worked. It is also meticulously plotted, which is a real pleasure when so many shows lately have felt like no one is at the wheel, pootling along aimlessly towards a finale (I’m looking at you, Fallout and Stranger Things).\n\nThough it didn’t have the weight of a Le Carré novel behind it this time, season two was blessed with familiar faces: Hiddleston, Colman, Alistair Petrie and Douglas Hodge all returned, as did one surprise, hidden entirely on the press tour – Laurie at his glowering best as Roper, seemingly back from the dead. But it was the new faces that impressed me most: the magnetic Diego Calva as the Colombian arms dealer Teddy Dos Santos, who seems to be importing British arms into the country and building a guerrilla army; and Camila Morrone as Roxana Bolaños, a steely informant who becomes Pine’s way into Dos Santos’s world.\n\n![Hugh Laurie as Richard Onslow Roper and Diego Calva as Teddy Dos Santos in The Night Manager](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f444d58bff1605912f594161384a7a670d50383f/0_0_4285_2857/master/4285.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)\n\nFamily affairs … Hugh Laurie as Richard Onslow Roper and Diego Calva as Teddy Dos Santos. Photograph: Des Willie/Ink Factory/BBC\n\nArms dealers, beautiful women, rotten establishments, spies spying on spies – it seemed like season two might be just a tropical spin on the first. But the best thing about The Night Manager is how it pretended to meet our expectations, then subverted them entirely.\n\nThe Night Manager has often flirted with plotty silliness, but as soon as it was revealed Dos Santos’s father was an Englishman, it seemed like a disappointingly obvious callback; Le Carré does Star Wars. But then, the true reveal: daddy dearest was still alive, and working with his son to rebuild his empire. “When you’ve slain the dragon,” Roper said, “always check its breath.”\n\nBolaños was not just another Jed, a hot bod for ravishing; she openly hates Pine for the danger he’s put her in and ends up betraying him entirely. It was Dos Santos, with all his daddy issues, who seemed more infatuated with this dishy British, blue-eyed man with his nice shirts. (Their three-way dance, by the by – the sexiest thing on television in yonks and no one even kissed.) “Were you *susceptible*?” Roper asked his son in episode five, and Dos Santos’s pause was the answer.\n\nHiddleston and Laurie going toe-to-toe again made me want to punch the air. In a 10-minute showdown, a tense steak lunch that ranks up there with the diner scene in Heat, Roper offers Pine an ultimatum: come on board or die. “I have inexplicable affection for you,” he says, as explanation.\n\nIt is down to their chemistry that part of you wants Pine to say “yes”, while the rest of you hopes he says “no” so they can keep finding each other, as certain as death and taxes. Laurie clearly revels in Roper, a man who says things like, “Conscience and shame are the shackles of slaves!” and tauntingly quotes Macbeth – “If it were done when ’tis done, then ’twere well. It were done quickly!” – while his son points a gun at his forehead.\n\nAnd poor, doomed Dos Santos. Having convinced him to betray his father, Pine advised him to put on a brave face and act loyal – “like a dog”, he said, not knowing that Roper just shot three of his own dogs dead without a blink. In the end, Dos Santos was executed by his father, the plane transporting the arms contained only a gloriously theatrical “bite me” to the few remaining do-gooders, Burr was murdered and Pine was left bleeding out in the Colombian jungle. Roper, meanwhile, got his British passport, his promised Oxford mansion and his son back. This time, he well and truly won. For now, at least – season three is, thankfully, already in pre-production.",

					"content": "Always the prophet. We didn’t really want to let Roper go, and Pine’s unknowability, the flicker in his eyes when Roper promised him the world, was his biggest appeal. The second season relied heavily on both these facts, which is part of why it worked. It is also meticulously plotted, which is a real pleasure when so many shows lately have felt like no one is at the wheel, pootling along aimlessly towards a finale (I’m looking at you, Fallout and Stranger Things).\n\nThough it didn’t have the weight of a Le Carré novel behind it this time, season two was blessed with familiar faces: Hiddleston, Colman, Alistair Petrie and Douglas Hodge all returned, as did one surprise, hidden entirely on the press tour – Laurie at his glowering best as Roper, seemingly back from the dead. But it was the new faces that impressed me most: the magnetic Diego Calva as the Colombian arms dealer Teddy Dos Santos, who seems to be importing British arms into the country and building a guerrilla army; and Camila Morrone as Roxana Bolaños, a steely informant who becomes Pine’s way into Dos Santos’s world.\n\n![Hugh Laurie as Richard Onslow Roper and Diego Calva as Teddy Dos Santos in The Night Manager](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f444d58bff1605912f594161384a7a670d50383f/0_0_4285_2857/master/4285.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)\n\nFamily affairs … Hugh Laurie as Richard Onslow Roper and Diego Calva as Teddy Dos Santos. Photograph: Des Willie/Ink Factory/BBC\n\nArms dealers, beautiful women, rotten establishments, spies spying on spies – it seemed like season two might be just a tropical spin on the first. But the best thing about The Night Manager is how it pretended to meet our expectations, then subverted them entirely.\n\nThe Night Manager has often flirted with plotty silliness, but as soon as it was revealed Dos Santos’s father was an Englishman, it seemed like a disappointingly obvious callback; Le Carré does Star Wars. But then, the true reveal: daddy dearest was still alive, and working with his son to rebuild his empire. “When you’ve slain the dragon,” Roper said, “always check its breath.”",

					"content": "Bolaños was not just another Jed, a hot bod for ravishing; she openly hates Pine for the danger he’s put her in and ends up betraying him entirely. It was Dos Santos, with all his daddy issues, who seemed more infatuated with this dishy British, blue-eyed man with his nice shirts. (Their three-way dance, by the by – the sexiest thing on television in yonks and no one even kissed.) “Were you *susceptible*?” Roper asked his son in episode five, and Dos Santos’s pause was the answer.\n\nHiddleston and Laurie going toe-to-toe again made me want to punch the air. In a 10-minute showdown, a tense steak lunch that ranks up there with the diner scene in Heat, Roper offers Pine an ultimatum: come on board or die. “I have inexplicable affection for you,” he says, as explanation.\n\nIt is down to their chemistry that part of you wants Pine to say “yes”, while the rest of you hopes he says “no” so they can keep finding each other, as certain as death and taxes. Laurie clearly revels in Roper, a man who says things like, “Conscience and shame are the shackles of slaves!” and tauntingly quotes Macbeth – “If it were done when ’tis done, then ’twere well. It were done quickly!” – while his son points a gun at his forehead.\n\nAnd poor, doomed Dos Santos. Having convinced him to betray his father, Pine advised him to put on a brave face and act loyal – “like a dog”, he said, not knowing that Roper just shot three of his own dogs dead without a blink. In the end, Dos Santos was executed by his father, the plane transporting the arms contained only a gloriously theatrical “bite me” to the few remaining do-gooders, Burr was murdered and Pine was left bleeding out in the Colombian jungle. Roper, meanwhile, got his British passport, his promised Oxford mansion and his son back. This time, he well and truly won. For now, at least – season three is, thankfully, already in pre-production.",
