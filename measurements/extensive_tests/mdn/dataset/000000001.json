			"markdown": "## Fetch API\n\nThe Fetch API provides an interface for fetching resources (including across the network). It is a more powerful and flexible replacement for [`XMLHttpRequest`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest).\n\n### In this article\n\n- Concepts and usage- Interfaces- HTTP headers- Specifications- Browser compatibility- See also\n\n### Concepts and usage\n\nThe Fetch API uses [`Request`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) and [`Response`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) objects (and other things involved with network requests), as well as related concepts such as CORS and the HTTP Origin header semantics.\n\nFor making a request and fetching a resource, use the [`fetch()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/fetch) method. It is a global method in both [`Window`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window) and [`Worker`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WorkerGlobalScope) contexts. This makes it available in pretty much any context you might want to fetch resources in.\n\nThe `fetch()` method takes one mandatory argument, the path to the resource you want to fetch. It returns a [`Promise`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) that resolves to the [`Response`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) to that request — as soon as the server responds with headers — **even if the server response is an HTTP error status**. You can also optionally pass in an `init` options object as the second argument (see [`Request`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request)).\n\nOnce a [`Response`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) is retrieved, there are a number of methods available to define what the body content is and how it should be handled.\n\nYou can create a request and response directly using the [`Request()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request/Request) and [`Response()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/Response) constructors, but it's uncommon to do this directly. Instead, these are more likely to be created as results of other API actions (for example, [`FetchEvent.respondWith()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/FetchEvent/respondWith) from service workers).\n\nFind out more about using the Fetch API features in [Using Fetch](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch).\n\n#### Deferred Fetch\n\nThe [`fetchLater()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/fetchLater) API enables a developer to request a *deferred fetch*, that can be sent after a specified period of time, or when the page is closed or navigated away from. See [Using Deferred Fetch](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Deferred_Fetch).\n\n### Interfaces\n\n[`Window.fetch()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/fetch) and [`WorkerGlobalScope.fetch()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WorkerGlobalScope/fetch)\n\nThe `fetch()` method used to fetch a resource.\n\n[`Window.fetchLater()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/fetchLater)\n\nUsed to make a deferred fetch request.\n\n[`DeferredRequestInit`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/DeferredRequestInit)\n\nRepresents the set of options that can be used to configure a deferred fetch request.\n\n[`FetchLaterResult`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/FetchLaterResult)\n\nRepresents the result of requesting a deferred fetch.\n\n[`Headers`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Headers)\n\nRepresents response/request headers, allowing you to query them and take different actions depending on the results.\n\n[`Request`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request)\n\nRepresents a resource request.\n\n[`Response`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response)\n\nRepresents the response to a request.\n\n### HTTP headers\n\n[`deferred-fetch`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Permissions-Policy/deferred-fetch)\n\nControls the [top-level quota](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Deferred_Fetch#quotas) for the `fetchLater()` API.\n\n[`deferred-fetch-minimal`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Permissions-Policy/deferred-fetch-minimal)\n\nControls the [shared cross-origin subframe quota](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Deferred_Fetch#quotas) for the `fetchLater()` API.\n\n### Specifications\n\nSpecification\n\n[Fetch\n\\# fetch-method](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#fetch-method)\n\n[Fetch\n\\# deferred-fetch](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#deferred-fetch)\n\n### Browser compatibility\n\n#### api.fetch\n\n#### api.Window.fetchLater\n\n### Help improve MDN\n\n[Learn how to contribute](/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Getting_started)\n\nThis page was last modified on Jan 8, 2026 by [MDN contributors](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/contributors.txt).\n\n[View this page on GitHub](https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/files/en-us/web/api/fetch_api/index.md?plain=1) • [Report a problem with this content](https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/new?template=page-report.yml&mdn-url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.mozilla.org%2Fen-US%2Fdocs%2FWeb%2FAPI%2FFetch_API&metadata=%3C%21--+Do+not+make+changes+below+this+line+--%3E%0A%3Cdetails%3E%0A%3Csummary%3EPage+report+details%3C%2Fsummary%3E%0A%0A*+Folder%3A+%60en-us%2Fweb%2Fapi%2Ffetch_api%60%0A*+MDN+URL%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.mozilla.org%2Fen-US%2Fdocs%2FWeb%2FAPI%2FFetch_API%0A*+GitHub+URL%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmdn%2Fcontent%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Ffiles%2Fen-us%2Fweb%2Fapi%2Ffetch_api%2Findex.md%0A*+Last+commit%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmdn%2Fcontent%2Fcommit%2F8c1bc8d99fc8301fbbe874f6dcf8d41a9f4fe5fb%0A*+Document+last+modified%3A+2026-01-08T22%3A18%3A49.000Z%0A%0A%3C%2Fdetails%3E)",
