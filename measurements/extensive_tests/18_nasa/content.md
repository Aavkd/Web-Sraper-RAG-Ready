## Moonbound

Four astronauts will venture around the Moon on Artemis II, the first crewed mission on NASA's path to establishing a long-term presence at the Moon for science and exploration through Artemis.  The 10-day flight will help confirm systems and hardware needed for early human lunar exploration missions. The first potential opportunity to launch is no earlier than Sunday, Feb. 8.

## 50 Years of Innovation

As NASA fosters technologies crucial for space exploration, the agency’s Technology Transfer program has the sole mission of getting those innovations into the hands of companies, entrepreneurs, and, ultimately, everyday people. The agency’s "Spinoff" publication has captured this endeavor for half a century.

### First AI-Planned Drive on Mars

NASA’s Perseverance Mars rover has completed the first drives on another world that were planned by artificial intelligence. Executed on Dec. 8 and 10, and led by the agency’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, the demonstration used generative AI to create waypoints for Perseverance, a complex decision-making task typically performed manually by the mission’s human rover planners.
