After [v2's official release](https://docusaurus.io/blog/2022/08/01/announcing-docusaurus-2.0), we highly encourage you to **use Docusaurus v2+ over Docusaurus v1**, as Docusaurus v1 has been deprecated.\n\nA [lot of users](https://docusaurus.io/showcase) are already using Docusaurus v2+ ([trends](https://www.npmtrends.com/docusaurus-vs-@docusaurus/core)).\n\n**Use Docusaurus v2+ if:**\n\n- ✅You want a modern Jamstack documentation site- ✅You want a single-page application (SPA) with client-side routing- ✅You want the full power of React and MDX- ✅You do not need support for IE11\n\n**Use [Docusaurus v1](https://v1.docusaurus.io/) if:**\n\n- ❌You don't want a single-page application (SPA)- ❌You need support for IE11 (...do you?

Docusaurus v2+ follows the [PRPL Pattern](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/prpl-pattern/)that makes sure your content loads blazing fast.- 🦖 **Accessible**. Attention to accessibility, making your site equally accessible to all users.\n\n- **Little to learn**. Docusaurus should be easy to learn and use as the API is quite small. Most things will still be achievable by users, even if it takes them more code and more time to write. Not having abstractions is better than having the wrong abstractions, and we don't want users to have to hack around the wrong abstractions. Mandatory talk— [Minimal API Surface Area](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4anAwXYqLG8).- **Intuitive**. Users will not feel overwhelmed when looking at the project directory of a Docusaurus project or adding new features.

Common and popular performance optimizations and configurations will be done for users but they are given the option to override them.- **No vendor lock-in**. Users are not required to use the default plugins or CSS, although they are highly encouraged to. Certain core infrastructures like React Loadable and React Router cannot be swapped because we do default performance optimization on them, but not higher-level ones. Choice of Markdown engines, CSS frameworks, CSS methodology, and other architectures will be entirely up to users.\n\nWe believe that, as developers, knowing how a library works helps us become better at using it. Hence we're dedicating effort to explaining the architecture and various components of Docusaurus with the hope that users reading it will gain a deeper understanding of the tool and be even more proficient in using it.\n\nAcross all static site generators, Docusaurus has a unique focus on documentation sites and has many out-of-the-box features.\n\nWe've also studied other main static site generators and would like to share our insights on the comparison, hopefully helping you navigate through the prismatic choices out there.\n\n### Gatsby​\n\n[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) is packed with a lot of features, has a rich ecosystem of plugins, and is capable of doing everything that Docusaurus does. Naturally, that comes at a cost of a higher learning curve. Gatsby does many things well and is suitable for building many types of websites. On the other hand, Docusaurus tries to do one thing super well - be the best tool for writing and publishing content.\n\nGraphQL is also pretty core to Gatsby, although you don't necessarily need GraphQL to build a Gatsby site. In most cases when building static websites, you won't need the flexibility that GraphQL provides.\n\nMany aspects of Docusaurus v2+ were inspired by the best things about Gatsby and it's a great alternative.\n\n[Docz](https://github.com/pedronauck/docz) is a Gatsby theme to build documentation websites. It is currently less featured than Docusaurus.\n\n### Next.js​\n\n[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is another very popular hybrid React framework. It can help you build a good documentation website, but it is not opinionated toward the documentation use-case, and it will require a lot more work to implement what Docusaurus provides out-of-the-box.\n\n[Nextra](https://github.com/shuding/nextra) is an opinionated static site generator built on top of Next.js. It is currently less featured than Docusaurus.\n\n### VitePress​\n\n[VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/) has many similarities with Docusaurus - both focus heavily on content-centric websites and provides tailored documentation features out of the box. However, VitePress is powered by Vue, while Docusaurus is powered by React. If you want a Vue-based solution, VitePress would be a decent choice.\n\n### MkDocs​\n\n[MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) is a popular Python static site generator with value propositions similar to Docusaurus.\n\nIt is a good option if you don't need a single-page application and don't plan to leverage React.\n\n[Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) is a beautiful theme.\n\n### Docsify​\n\n[Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/) makes it easy to create a documentation website, but is not a static-site generator and is not SEO friendly.\n\n### GitBook​\n\n[GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/) has a very clean design and has been used by many open source projects. With its focus shifting towards a commercial product rather than an open-source tool, many of its requirements no longer fit the needs of open source projects' documentation sites. As a result, many have turned to other products. You may read about Redux's switch to Docusaurus [here](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/issues/3161).\n\nCurrently, GitBook is only free for open-source and non-profit teams. Docusaurus is free for everyone.\n\n### Jekyll​\n\n[Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) is one of the most mature static site generators around and has been a great tool to use — in fact, before Docusaurus, most of Facebook's Open Source websites are/were built on Jekyll! It is extremely simple to get started. We want to bring a similar developer experience as building a static site with Jekyll.\n\nIn comparison with statically generated HTML and interactivity added using `<script />` tags, Docusaurus sites are React apps. Using modern JavaScript ecosystem tooling, we hope to set new standards on doc sites' performance, asset building pipeline and optimizations, and ease to set up.\n\n### Rspress​\n\n[Rspress](https://rspress.dev/) is a fast static site generator based on Rspack, a Rust-based bundler. It supports content writing with MDX (Markdown with React components), integrated text search, multilingual support (i18n), and extensibility through plugins. Designed for creating elegant documentation and static websites, Rspress produces static HTML files that are easy to deploy.\n\nRspress and Docusaurus are quite similar. They both have their pros and cons. Rspress was created more recently and benefits from a modern infrastructure that enables faster site builds. Docusaurus stands out for its maturity, comprehensive feature set, flexibility, and strong community. It is also [modernizing its infrastructure](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/10556) regularly to remain competitive in terms of performance.\n\n- [GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus)\n- [X](https://x.com/docusaurus)\n- [Blog](https://docusaurus.io/blog)\n- [Discord](https://discord.gg/docusaurus)\n\nIf you find issues with the documentation or have suggestions on how to improve the documentation or the project in general, please [file an issue](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus) for us, or send a tweet mentioning the [@docusaurus](https://x.com/docusaurus) X account.\n\nFor new feature requests, you can create a post on our [feature requests board (Canny)](https://docusaurus.io/feature-requests), which is a handy tool for road-mapping and allows for sorting by upvotes, which gives the core team a better indicator of what features are in high demand, as compared to GitHub issues which are harder to triage.

We even have the honor of being a favorite. We are really happy that we found this project. It helped us a lot to improve the documentation. And we still have a lot of plans with things like tutorials, versioning and i18n.\n\nI've used Docusaurus for two websites this year, and I've been very happy about the v2. Looks good, and simple to setup.\n\nContinue to be impressed and excited about Docusaurus v2 alpha releases.

					"content": "## Loved by many engineers\n\nWe've been using Docusaurus for all the Redux org docs sites for the last couple years, and it's great! We've been able to focus on content, customize some presentation and features, and It Just Works.\n\nWe've been using V2 since January and it has been great - we spend less time building documentation and more time building 🛳\n\nThanks **@docusaurus** team 🦖\n\nThe #IOTA wiki is now part of the **@docusaurus** showcase. We even have the honor of being a favorite. We are really happy that we found this project. It helped us a lot to improve the documentation. And we still have a lot of plans with things like tutorials, versioning and i18n.\n\nI've used Docusaurus for two websites this year, and I've been very happy about the v2. Looks good, and simple to setup.\n\nContinue to be impressed and excited about Docusaurus v2 alpha releases. Already using the sidebar items generator to help monorepo workspace devs create their own doc pages without any configuration needed.\n\nhttps://testing-library.com just got a nice update! We're now on the latest version of **@docusaurus** thanks to @matanbobi, @TensorNo, and @nickemccurdy 💙\n\nMy favorite new feature: dark mode!! 🌑/☀️\n\nDocusaurus v2 doubles as a really nice little static site generator tool for content-focused sites, love it 👏\n\nBeen doing a lot of work with **@docusaurus** lately and I have to say it is really fun to work with. A lot of really cool features. I love that you can easily reuse content by creating a markdown file and importing it as a component. 🔥\n\nHappy to share Temporal's first open source sponsorship — of\n\n**@docusaurus**!\n\n@temporalio uses it for https://docs.temporal.io, and it has been a huge boon to our docs team. @sebastienlorber is an incredible steward of the project, support it if you can!\n\nChristopher \"vjeux\" Chedeau\n\nLead Prettier Developer\n\nI've helped open source many projects at Facebook and every one needed a website. They all had very similar constraints: the documentation should be written in markdown and be deployed via GitHub pages. I’m so glad that Docusaurus now exists so that I don’t have to spend a week each time spinning up a new one.\n\nHector Ramos\n\nLead React Native Advocate\n\nOpen source contributions to the React Native docs have skyrocketed after our move to Docusaurus. The docs are now hosted on a small repo in plain markdown, with none of the clutter that a typical static site generator would require. Thanks Slash!\n\nRicky Vetter\n\nReasonReact Developer\n\nDocusaurus has been a great choice for the ReasonML family of projects. It makes our documentation consistent, i18n-friendly, easy to maintain, and friendly for new contributors.",

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), and minor version updates have **no breaking changes**, accordingly to our [release process](https://docusaurus.io/community/release-process). Note that **we consider dropping End-of-Life Node.js versions as non-breaking changes**.\n\n![Docusaurus blog post social card](https://docusaurus.io/assets/images/social-card-e8a5c83b31b6ac5bb461df1568d7577f.png)\n\nIn [#11408](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/11408), we have dropped support for Node.js 18, and the new minimum required Node.js version is now v20.0.\n\nAlthough it may look like a runtime requirement breaking change, Node.js 18 reached [End-of-Life](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/). It [won't receive security updates](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/announcements/node-18-eol-support), and you shouldn't use it anymore. Dropping End-of-Life versions of Node.js on minor version releases is a common practice in the Node.js ecosystem, that we now officially endorse and document on our [release process](https://docusaurus.io/community/release-process#nodejs-support).\n\nThis upgrade is further motivated by our dependencies:\n\n- Some of our dependencies now only receive security patches on newer versions that do not support Node.js 18 anymore. See, for example, this [webpack-dev-server@4 security warning](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/11410). To keep the Docusaurus v3 release line secure for our users, for both the runtime and third-party dependencies, the upgrade is necessary.- Some of our dependencies are also dropping support for Node.js 18 in minor releases, transitively impacting Docusaurus runtime requirements. For example, [Rspack 1.5 now requires Node.js 18.12](https://rspack.rs/blog/announcing-1-5), while Docusaurus v3 initially supported Node.js 18.0.\n\nIn [#11327](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/11327) and [#11421](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/11421), we added support for Algolia DocSearch v4. This new version comes with [AskAI](https://docsearch.algolia.com/docs/v4/askai) support, letting you add an AI-powered search assistant to your Docusaurus site that can answer questions based on what's in your documentation with a conversational experience.\n\n![Algolia DocSearch v4 - Ask AI screenshot](https://docusaurus.io/assets/images/askai-0443fb4e7ddd4420f61d87c5a10d9be6.png)\n\nDocSearch v4 is opt-in\n\nDocusaurus v3 adds support for DocSearch v4 while keeping support for DocSearch v3.\n\nExisting sites using DocSearch v3 can either stay on v3 or upgrade to v4 using their package manager (npm command: `npm update @docsearch/react`).\n\nWhen using DocSearch v4, the new AskAI feature is not enabled by default: you also need to [create an AskAI assistant](https://docsearch.algolia.com/docs/v4/askai/) and add it to the [`themeConfig.algolia.askAi` config attribute](https://docusaurus.io/docs/search#ask-ai).\n\nIn [#11316](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/11316), we added new `i18n.localeConfigs[locale].{url,baseUrl}` config options to better support complex and multi-domain i18n deployments. Previously, Docusaurus relied on hard-coded heuristics that made sense for most i18n projects, but weren't flexible enough to accommodate all use cases, leading UX and SEO issues. It is now possible to configure each locale's deployment URL and base URL independently, overriding the default values inferred by Docusaurus:\n\ndocusaurus.config.js\n\n```javascript\nexport default { i18n: { defaultLocale: 'en', locales: ['en', 'fr'], localeConfigs: { en: { url: 'https://en.docusaurus.io', baseUrl: '/', }, fr: { url: 'https://fr.docusaurus.io', baseUrl: '/', }, }, },};\n```\n\nIn [#11304](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/11304), we optimized our i18n infrastructure with a new `i18n.localeConfigs[locale].translate` flag that is now `false` by default for sites that do not use any translations. This leads to an improved dev experience and faster builds for non-i18n sites by avoiding unnecessary file system read attempts of the `i18n` directory.\n\nIn [#11228](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/11228), we added a new `key` attribute to the docs sidebar items, allowing to assign explicit translation keys to each sidebar item that use the same label and would otherwise lead to translation key conflicts:\n\nsidebars.js\n\n```javascript\nexport default { sidebar: [ { type: 'category', label: 'API', key: 'api-for-feature-1', items: [], }, { type: 'category', label: 'API', key: 'api-for-feature-2', items: [], }, ],};\n```\n\nIn [#11357](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/11357), we added support for [Mermaid ELK layout algorithm](https://mermaid.js.org/intro/syntax-reference.html#supported-layout-algorithms), based on the [Eclipse Layout Kernel (ELK)](https://www.eclipse.org/elk/). Compared to the default Dagre layout, it provides more sophisticated layout capabilities and configuration options, especially useful when working with large or intricate diagrams.\n\nYou can enable it by adding the extra `@mermaid-js/layout-elk` npm dependency, making it possible to use the `layout: elk` Mermaid diagram metadata:\n\n```text\n```mermaid---config: layout: elk---erDiagram CUSTOMER ||--o{ ORDER : places ORDER ||--|{ LINE-ITEM : contains CUSTOMER }|..|{ DELIVERY-ADDRESS : uses```text\n```\n\n- 🇧🇷 [#11315](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/11315): Add missing Brazilian Portuguese theme translations.- 🇺🇦 [#11305](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/11305): Add missing Ukrainian theme translations.\n\nOther notable changes include:\n\n- In [#11283](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/11283), we added `siteConfig.markdown.hooks.{onBrokenMarkdownLinks,onBrokenMarkdownImages}`and deprecated `siteConfig.onBrokenMarkdownLinks`. The new callback hooks also let you recover from broken links/images by returning a fallback URL.- In [#11282](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/11282), we added the `siteConfig.markdown.emoji`config option to disable the previously hard-coded `remark-emoji`behavior.- In [#11397](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/11397), we can now resolve site-aliased Markdown links starting with `@site/*`, that we already supported for ES imports.- In [#11294](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/11294)and [#11415](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/11415), we upgraded to Rspack 1.5 and leveraging new Rspack config options to make Docusaurus build faster.- In [#11356](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/11356), we improved the display of docs sidebar items with long labels.- In [#11405](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/11405), we improved visual glitches caused by the `useColorMode()`hook when switching color modes, glitches that also affected your site's logo in the navbar.- In [#11383](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/11383), we disabled a Docusaurus Faster HTML minifier optimization that prevents your site's social card from displaying properly on some social platforms (e.g., LinkedIn).- In [#11425](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/11425), we added the ability for blog authors to display an email icon with a `mailto:`link ( `author.socials.email`).- In [#11422](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/11422), we removed the `copy-text-to-clipboard`in favor of the native `navigator.clipboard`API.\n\nCheck the **[3.9.0 changelog entry](https://docusaurus.io/changelog/3.9.0)** for an exhaustive list of changes.",
