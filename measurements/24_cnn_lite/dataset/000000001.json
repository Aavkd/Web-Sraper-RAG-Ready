			"markdown": "## Right-wing populist Laura Fernández claims victory in Costa Rica’s elections. Here’s what to know.\n\nUpdated: 12:52 AM EST, Mon February 2, 2026\n\nSource: CNN\n\nConservative populist Laura Fernández claimed victory in Costa Rica’s presidential race, with early results also pointing to her ruling party securing a majority in an election overshadowed by crime and political apathy.\n\nAmid persisting violence from criminal groups in a country long considered [a peaceful tourist hub](https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/31/world/video/costa-rica-drop-in-tourism-amid-rise-in-crime), polling [reveals](https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2026/01/28/latinoamerica/costa-rica-elecciones-presidenciales-encuestas-candidato-favorito-orix#:~:text=La%20lucha%20contra%20la%20inseguridad%20y%20crimen%20organizado%2C%20ejes%20de%20la%20campa%C3%B1a) that Costa Ricans are most concerned about security this year. Voters are also distressed by the decline in their quality of life, as well as the country’s muddled political landscape – a fact indicated by the twenty candidates for president alone.\n\nWith more than 80% of the polling stations counted, Fernández had secured 48.94% of the votes –– enough to avoid a runoff in the race for the presidency.\n\nFernández was handpicked by President Rodrigo Chaves to run as his successor and has pledged to continue with his tough on crime policies.\n\n“Costa Rica has voted for the continuity of change, a change that seeks to restore and improve institutions and return them to the sovereign people in order to create greater well-being and prosperity,” Fernández told supporters after the preliminary results were announced.\n\nHer closest rival Álvaro Ramos, a centrist economist representing Costa Rica’s oldest political party, conceded late on Sunday, saying his party would “support her when her decisions are for the good of the country.”\n\nIn Costa Rica, a candidate must obtain at least 40% of the vote to win the presidency in the first round. If no one reaches that threshold, the top two head to a runoff.\n\nThe early results projected Fernandez’s Sovereign People’s Party would also claim a majority of 30 seats in the 57-seat Congress, up from its current eight seats.\n\nCosta Rica’s struggle with criminal violence in recent years is a cruel irony. The country has long been a model for peace. It was the [first nation to abolish its armed forces](https://www.unesco.org/en/memory-world/abolition-army-costa-rica), a point of national pride in a region marked by political turmoil.\n\nYet government figures show that the last three years have been some of the most violent in recent Costa Rican history, with 905 homicides in 2023, an all-time record. The government attributes much of the violence to drug trafficking.

According to Merino, three decades ago nearly every person in Costa Rica was affiliated with a political party. Today, barely a fifth of the country identifies with a party.\n\n“It is a worrying trend,” Merino said. “Fewer and fewer people are voting, young people are participating less and now even older adults are staying away from the polls.”\n\nIn 2022, Costa Rica registered the [lowest voter turnout](https://www.tse.go.cr/pdf/elecciones/eleccionescifras.pdf) in its recent history, with two out of five eligible voters staying home on election day.\n\nBoth Díaz and Merino agree that the Costa Rican social pact — built over more than a century — is at stake. Environmental concerns have [held a central place](https://revista.drclas.harvard.edu/pura-vida-pura-sustainability-costa-ricas-path-to-a-green-future/) in Costa Rica’s identity for years, much like its lack of a standing army, and the country has set ambitious [sustainability goals](https://revista.drclas.harvard.edu/pura-vida-pura-sustainability-costa-ricas-path-to-a-green-future/).\n\nBut the two political scientists say that even that is changing.

Voters are also distressed by the decline in their quality of life, as well as the country’s muddled political landscape – a fact indicated by the twenty candidates for president alone.\n\nWith more than 80% of the polling stations counted, Fernández had secured 48.94% of the votes –– enough to avoid a runoff in the race for the presidency.\n\nFernández was handpicked by President Rodrigo Chaves to run as his successor and has pledged to continue with his tough on crime policies.\n\n“Costa Rica has voted for the continuity of change, a change that seeks to restore and improve institutions and return them to the sovereign people in order to create greater well-being and prosperity,” Fernández told supporters after the preliminary results were announced.\n\nHer closest rival Álvaro Ramos, a centrist economist representing Costa Rica’s oldest political party, conceded late on Sunday, saying his party would “support her when her decisions are for the good of the country.”\n\nIn Costa Rica, a candidate must obtain at least 40% of the vote to win the presidency in the first round. If no one reaches that threshold, the top two head to a runoff.\n\nThe early results projected Fernandez’s Sovereign People’s Party would also claim a majority of 30 seats in the 57-seat Congress, up from its current eight seats.",

There were also trains galore, perhaps none longer than the 13-foot one trailing from the back of Doechii’s Roberto Cavalli dress.\n\nElsewhere, musical style icons put inventive spins on red-carpet convention, including Billie Eilish in a deconstructed suit by Hodakova and Bad Bunny in a tuxedo with corset detailing (the first major foray into men’s suiting by surrealist womenswear label Schiaparelli). The 95 categories — a record number for the Grammys — also provided numerous breakout stars with a chance to impress fashion-watchers, from Addison Rae in Alaïa to the singing cast of “[KPop Demon Hunters](https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/27/business/ejae-kpop-demon-hunters-risk-takers)” in looks by Dior, Guvanch and Thom Browne.\n\nThere were risqué moments from Heidi Klum, in a skin-tight molded “naked” dress, and Chappell Roan, who removed her cape to reveal a Mugler négligée gown held in place with nipple clamps. But it wasn’t all fun and frills. From Finneas to the Biebers, several attendees were pictured wearing “ICE Out” and “Be Good” badges to protest the Trump administration’s ongoing immigration crackdown.\n\n*See below for the red carpet’s most striking looks.*\n\n[See Full Web Article](https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/01/style/red-carpet-grammy-looks-dress)",

			"markdown": "Updated: 12:26 AM EST, Mon February 2, 2026\n\nSource: CNN\n\nDeputy Attorney General Todd Blanche defended the Justice Department’s actions on multiple fronts Sunday, signaling that no new charges will be brought in the [Jeffrey Epstein investigation](https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/epstein-files-release-doj-01-30-26), downplaying Director of National Intelligence [Tulsi Gabbard’s involvement](https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/28/politics/fulton-county-election-office-fbi-warrant) in a probe into alleged voter fraud in Georgia, and defending the decision to arrest former [CNN anchor Don Lemon](https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/30/politics/don-lemon-custody).\n\nBlanche, in an interview on CNN’s “State of the Union,” emphasized that the Justice Department is handling the Epstein files, the Georgia 2020 election probe, and the Lemon case through established legal channels, pushing back against claims of political bias or irregularity.\n\nBlanche said the DOJ is not considering bringing any additional charges related to Epstein, after releasing millions of pages of documents tied to the convicted sex offender.\n\n“I can’t talk about any investigations, but I will say the following, which is that in July, the Department of Justice said that we had reviewed the files, the Epstein files, and there was nothing in there that allowed us to prosecute anybody,” Blanche told CNN’s Dana Bash.\n\n“The entire world can look at and see if we got it wrong.”\n\nBlanche acknowledged the materials contain disturbing content, including correspondence, emails and photographs, but stressed they do not meet the threshold for prosecution.\n\n“There’s a lot of horrible photographs that appear to be taken by Mr. Epstein or people around him, but that doesn’t allow us necessarily to prosecute somebody,” Blanche said.\n\nThe deputy attorney general also sought to temper the [focus on President Donald Trump](https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/31/politics/new-documents-trump-epstein), who is mentioned more than 1,000 times in the documents. “It’s about a ton of people … that were quoted in the Epstein files,” he told CNN. Trump has denied any wrongdoing and hasn’t been charged with any crime related to Epstein.\n\nBlanche noted that many of the allegations involving Trump came from anonymous tips or unverifiable sources.\n\n“It turns out, there was a number of claims made by either … anonymous people or somebody, for example, calling and saying, ‘I used to have a roommate who told me this sensational story.’ So just, you know, obviously that’s not something that can be really investigated, right? ‘What’s your roommate’s name? I don’t remember,’ So that’s what that’s about.”\n\nBlanche also addressed questions surrounding Gabbard’s presence during an FBI search of the Fulton County elections office in Georgia last week, saying he didn’t know why she was there. The search was related to an effort by the Justice Department to seize voting data and search for alleged fraud in the county, which has long been a centerpiece of Trump’s baseless claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him.\n\n“I don’t know why the director was there. She is not part of the grand jury investigation,” Blanche said.\n\n“But she is, for sure, a key part of our efforts at election integrity and making sure that we have free and fair elections,” he said. He emphasized that the investigation is being run by the FBI and cautioned against overstating Gabbard’s role.\n\nCNN has reported that the move appears to provide an opportunity for Gabbard to curry favor with Trump by supporting his false but unrelenting claims about the 2020 election. Trump on Thursday night praised Gabbard for “working very hard to try to keep the election safe” when asked by CNN why she was present during the search.\n\nThe director of national intelligence oversees all foreign intelligence collection. Their traditional role in US elections is to protect them from foreign interference.\n\nBlanche defended the Justice Department’s decision to bring charges against Lemon, countering criticism that the case amounts to criminalizing journalistic activity. Lemon and another independent journalist were arrested last week in connection with a protest at a church in St. Paul, Minnesota.\n\n“There was absolutely probable cause that a crime had been committed,” Blanche said. “Our system doesn’t allow judges to make that decision … but only a grand jury can bring forth an indictment, and so that’s what we did.”\n\nWhen asked whether Lemon’s actions could be seen as protected by the First Amendment, Blanche pointed to allegations that extend beyond ordinary journalistic activity.\n\n“There are multiple allegations there, and guess what? He gets to have a lawyer, and he gets to have a defense. If he wants to go forward with the defense at ‘Aw, shucks, I was just a journalist,’ he can do that.”\n\nHe also rejected the notion that the case was politically motivated. “I don’t even know that the president’s even ever thought of Don Lemon. … We’re not making examples of people.”\n\nTrump said Saturday he had no knowledge of Lemon’s arrest while launching personal attacks against the longtime journalist, calling him “a sleaze bag.”\n\n[See Full Web Article](https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/01/politics/blanche-epstein-gabbard-lemon)",
