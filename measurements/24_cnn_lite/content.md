## Right-wing populist Laura Fernández claims victory in Costa Rica’s elections. Here’s what to know.

Updated: 12:52 AM EST, Mon February 2, 2026

Conservative populist Laura Fernández claimed victory in Costa Rica’s presidential race, with early results also pointing to her ruling party securing a majority in an election overshadowed by crime and political apathy.

Amid persisting violence from criminal groups in a country long considered [a peaceful tourist hub](https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/31/world/video/costa-rica-drop-in-tourism-amid-rise-in-crime), polling [reveals](https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2026/01/28/latinoamerica/costa-rica-elecciones-presidenciales-encuestas-candidato-favorito-orix#:~:text=La%20lucha%20contra%20la%20inseguridad%20y%20crimen%20organizado%2C%20ejes%20de%20la%20campa%C3%B1a) that Costa Ricans are most concerned about security this year. Voters are also distressed by the decline in their quality of life, as well as the country’s muddled political landscape – a fact indicated by the twenty candidates for president alone.

With more than 80% of the polling stations counted, Fernández had secured 48.94% of the votes –– enough to avoid a runoff in the race for the presidency.

Fernández was handpicked by President Rodrigo Chaves to run as his successor and has pledged to continue with his tough on crime policies.

“Costa Rica has voted for the continuity of change, a change that seeks to restore and improve institutions and return them to the sovereign people in order to create greater well-being and prosperity,” Fernández told supporters after the preliminary results were announced.

Her closest rival Álvaro Ramos, a centrist economist representing Costa Rica’s oldest political party, conceded late on Sunday, saying his party would “support her when her decisions are for the good of the country.”

In Costa Rica, a candidate must obtain at least 40% of the vote to win the presidency in the first round. If no one reaches that threshold, the top two head to a runoff.

The early results projected Fernandez’s Sovereign People’s Party would also claim a majority of 30 seats in the 57-seat Congress, up from its current eight seats.

Costa Rica’s struggle with criminal violence in recent years is a cruel irony. The country has long been a model for peace. It was the [first nation to abolish its armed forces](https://www.unesco.org/en/memory-world/abolition-army-costa-rica), a point of national pride in a region marked by political turmoil.

Yet government figures show that the last three years have been some of the most violent in recent Costa Rican history, with 905 homicides in 2023, an all-time record. The government attributes much of the violence to drug trafficking. In January, the US Treasury [alleged](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0369) that the country has become a “key global cocaine transshipment point.”

Costa Rica is not alone in this trend, of course: crime-related fears drove thousands of Latin Americans to the polls in recent months, from Ecuador to Chile to Honduras. The region’s struggle against crime is overshadowed by one government in particular: El Salvador and its self-described “dictator” [Nayib Bukele.](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/01/americas/analysis-bukele-dictatorship-salvador-intl-latam)

Bukele brought murder rates in El Salvador to historic lows through a gargantuan imprisonment campaign and police crackdown, but faces numerous allegations of human rights violations, especially regarding his notorious [Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT).](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/08/americas/el-salvador-cecot-prison-deportees)

Nonetheless, he remains extremely popular in Latin America. He’s also sought to promote his brand of iron-fist rule in Costa Rica, where the government [broke ground on a CECOT-style prison](https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2026/01/15/latinoamerica/costa-rica-elecciones-visita-bukele-carcel-denuncia-complot-chaves-orix) last month with Bukele’s blessing.

“Nayib Bukele’s presence is important, legitimate, and honors us,” declared the retiring incumbent President Rodrigo Chaves at the groundbreaking ceremony.

José Andrés Díaz González, political scientist at Costa Rica’s National University in Heredia, told CNN that the security crisis is part and parcel with a decline in the country’s social services.

“The foundations of the social pact are being weakened,” Díaz said. “Health, with the accelerated deterioration of the Costa Rican Social Security Fund; education, as an engine of social mobility; and security, with the increase in homicides and the loss of the feeling of security in homes.”

Díaz pointed out that Costa Rica faces the same [demographic cliff](https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/20/health/global-fertility-rates-lancet-study) as many other countries: the population is [getting older](https://thecostaricanews.com/average-age-of-costa-ricans-will-go-from-34-to-47-years-by-2050/), threatening further strain on a safety net already coming apart at the seams.

“We are in a demographic transition that implies that fewer people will have to produce more,” Díaz explained. “In 15 or 20 years, the pension system will be under greater pressure, there will be fewer contributors, less tax revenues and greater demands for care for the elderly population.”

According to a 2025 report from the State of the Nation Program (PEN), a local think tank, Costa Rica experienced an economic rebound in 2024 and the first half of 2025.

The country became the first in Central America to join the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in 2021, and that organization’s latest reports on Costa Rica also paint a rosy initial picture: an “improved” fiscal situation with declining unemployment, declining debt and tech products making up a growing share of the country’s exports.

Among peer nations, OECD reported, Costa Rica’s growth has been “more resilient and stronger.”

The upward-trending numbers, however, only show half of the story, according to PEN political scientist Leonardo Merino.

“Costa Rica has economic growth that is disengaged from people’s well-being,” Merino told CNN. He explained that much of the growth is concentrated in so-called “free trade zones,” which offer significant tax breaks and customs exemptions for investors.

“Free trade zones are the main engine of growth, but they account for only 12% of employment and around 15% of production,” said Merino. “The domestic market economy, where the majority of the population is, is growing little and has been abandoned.”

OECD concurred with that assessment, too, writing that “innovation outcomes are weak” outside of free trade zones.

This wear and tear is also reflected in a marked political apathy among everyday Costa Ricans. According to Merino, three decades ago nearly every person in Costa Rica was affiliated with a political party. Today, barely a fifth of the country identifies with a party.

“It is a worrying trend,” Merino said. “Fewer and fewer people are voting, young people are participating less and now even older adults are staying away from the polls.”

In 2022, Costa Rica registered the [lowest voter turnout](https://www.tse.go.cr/pdf/elecciones/eleccionescifras.pdf) in its recent history, with two out of five eligible voters staying home on election day.

Both Díaz and Merino agree that the Costa Rican social pact — built over more than a century — is at stake. Environmental concerns have [held a central place](https://revista.drclas.harvard.edu/pura-vida-pura-sustainability-costa-ricas-path-to-a-green-future/) in Costa Rica’s identity for years, much like its lack of a standing army, and the country has set ambitious [sustainability goals](https://revista.drclas.harvard.edu/pura-vida-pura-sustainability-costa-ricas-path-to-a-green-future/).

But the two political scientists say that even that is changing. The idea of a “green Costa Rica” coexists today with proposals for ending a two-decade-old ban on [fossil fuel exploration](https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/12/19/costa-ricas-fossil-fuel-ban-hangs-by-a-thread) and exploiting natural resources such as precious metals, gas and oil.

“It’s not just a choice. If something is not done, the deterioration can continue,” said Díaz, “and so far no political party has considered this issue with the seriousness it requires.”

With voting now complete, attention turns to whether Costa Rica’s fractured electorate will deliver a first-round winner or force a runoff. The result of the election will not just determine who holds political office. It will also test the capacity of the country’s politicians to reconnect with an increasingly distant citizenry and resolve the tensions accumulating in Costa Rica’s social fabric. Will an army-less country known for its environmentalism become the next El Salvador?

It was a history-making night at the Grammy Awards.

[This year’s Super Bowl halftime performer Bad Bunny](https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/29/entertainment/bad-bunny-super-bowl-halftime-subversive) took home album of the year for “Debí Tirar Más Fotos (I Should Have Taken More Photos),” which became the first-ever Spanish-language album to nab the top prize. Amidst an effusive and emotional acceptance speech in Spanish, the Puerto Rican superstar said in English, “I want to dedicate this award to all the people who had to leave their homeland, their country to follow their dreams.”

Earlier in the show, Bad Bunny won for best música urbana album, and took a moment on stage to make a political statement, starting with a declaration of “ICE out,” which was met with extended, lengthy applause.

“We’re not savage, we’re not animals, we’re not aliens. We are humans and we are Americans,” Bad Bunny continued. “I also want to say to the people, I know it’s tough not to hate on these days and I was thinking, sometimes we get *contaminados*…. The hate get more powerful with more hate. The only thing that is more powerful than hate is love. So please, we need to be different. If we fight, we have to do it with love. If we don’t hate them, we love our people. We love our family and that’s the way to do it. Don’t forget that please.”

Another pre-show winner included last year’s Super Bowl [halftime show headliner Kendrick Lamar](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/09/entertainment/kendrick-lamar-halftime-show-super-bowl), who took home three Grammys before the show even started, nabbing another in the first hour of the telecast. With it, he broke the record previously held by Jay-Z and became the most awarded rapper in Grammys history. His wins this weekend included one for best rap album, for “GNX,” as well as record of the year alongside SZA for “luther.”

Like Bad Bunny, Billie Eilish – winner for song of the year for “Wildflower” – also made unfiltered statements about ICE while accepting a Grammy.

Standing on stage alongside her brother and producing partner Finneas O’Connell, Eilish, who has been an outspoken critic of actions made by ICE officials in recent weeks, said “no one is illegal on stolen land.”

Eilish’s final statement on stage was bleeped by television censors, but according to video footage posted online by those in attendance, she said, “F\*\*k ICE.”

Going into Sunday’s show, Lamar led with [nine nominations](https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/07/entertainment/grammy-award-nominations-2026), including for album of the year for his “GNX.”

Feted filmmaker Steven Spielberg clinched a Grammy before the show as well, joining the [elite ranks of EGOTs](https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/15/entertainment/elton-john-egot-emmys) (winners of an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony Award) when he was awarded a statuette for best music film for the documentary “Music by [John Williams](https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/23/entertainment/martin-scorsese-john-williams-oscars),” which he coproduced alongside Ron Howard and many others.

Performances included the likes of Lady Gaga, Justin Bieber, Sabrina Carpenter and all eight best new artist nominees – Addison Rae, Alex Warren, KATSEYE, Leon Thomas, Lola Young, Olivia Dean, SOMBR and The Marías.

## Red carpet looks at the Grammys: See which celebrities are best dressed

The music industry’s red carpets are usually bolder, brighter and more adventurous than their Hollywood counterparts. And they don’t get bigger than the [Grammys](https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/01/entertainment/grammy-awards-winners-list-live) — the awards ceremony that brought you Michael Jackson’s bedazzled military jacket, Pharrell Williams’ [oversized hat](https://www.cnn.com/style/article/pharrell-williams-the-hat-remember-when) and *that* plunging green Jennifer Lopez [dress](https://www.cnn.com/style/article/jennifer-lopez-versace-dress-jungle-iconic-trnd).

This year’s attendees brought their fair share of sartorial drama arriving at LA’s Crypto.com Arena in a blaze of feathers, ruffles and voluminous draping on Sunday evening.

Among the most striking looks were Blackpink singer Rosé’s theatrical take on a black minidress, by Giambattista Valli, and Lady Gaga’s feathery “black swan” gown, by the cult French brand Matières Fécales (yes, that translates as Fecal Matter). There were also trains galore, perhaps none longer than the 13-foot one trailing from the back of Doechii’s Roberto Cavalli dress.

Elsewhere, musical style icons put inventive spins on red-carpet convention, including Billie Eilish in a deconstructed suit by Hodakova and Bad Bunny in a tuxedo with corset detailing (the first major foray into men’s suiting by surrealist womenswear label Schiaparelli). The 95 categories — a record number for the Grammys — also provided numerous breakout stars with a chance to impress fashion-watchers, from Addison Rae in Alaïa to the singing cast of “[KPop Demon Hunters](https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/27/business/ejae-kpop-demon-hunters-risk-takers)” in looks by Dior, Guvanch and Thom Browne.

There were risqué moments from Heidi Klum, in a skin-tight molded “naked” dress, and Chappell Roan, who removed her cape to reveal a Mugler négligée gown held in place with nipple clamps. But it wasn’t all fun and frills. From Finneas to the Biebers, several attendees were pictured wearing “ICE Out” and “Be Good” badges to protest the Trump administration’s ongoing immigration crackdown.

## Deputy attorney general signals no new Epstein charges, defends Gabbard role in Georgia election search

Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche defended the Justice Department’s actions on multiple fronts Sunday, signaling that no new charges will be brought in the [Jeffrey Epstein investigation](https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/epstein-files-release-doj-01-30-26), downplaying Director of National Intelligence [Tulsi Gabbard’s involvement](https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/28/politics/fulton-county-election-office-fbi-warrant) in a probe into alleged voter fraud in Georgia, and defending the decision to arrest former [CNN anchor Don Lemon](https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/30/politics/don-lemon-custody).

Blanche, in an interview on CNN’s “State of the Union,” emphasized that the Justice Department is handling the Epstein files, the Georgia 2020 election probe, and the Lemon case through established legal channels, pushing back against claims of political bias or irregularity.

Blanche said the DOJ is not considering bringing any additional charges related to Epstein, after releasing millions of pages of documents tied to the convicted sex offender.

“I can’t talk about any investigations, but I will say the following, which is that in July, the Department of Justice said that we had reviewed the files, the Epstein files, and there was nothing in there that allowed us to prosecute anybody,” Blanche told CNN’s Dana Bash.

“The entire world can look at and see if we got it wrong.”

Blanche acknowledged the materials contain disturbing content, including correspondence, emails and photographs, but stressed they do not meet the threshold for prosecution.

“There’s a lot of horrible photographs that appear to be taken by Mr. Epstein or people around him, but that doesn’t allow us necessarily to prosecute somebody,” Blanche said.

The deputy attorney general also sought to temper the [focus on President Donald Trump](https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/31/politics/new-documents-trump-epstein), who is mentioned more than 1,000 times in the documents. “It’s about a ton of people … that were quoted in the Epstein files,” he told CNN. Trump has denied any wrongdoing and hasn’t been charged with any crime related to Epstein.

Blanche noted that many of the allegations involving Trump came from anonymous tips or unverifiable sources.

“It turns out, there was a number of claims made by either … anonymous people or somebody, for example, calling and saying, ‘I used to have a roommate who told me this sensational story.’ So just, you know, obviously that’s not something that can be really investigated, right? ‘What’s your roommate’s name? I don’t remember,’ So that’s what that’s about.”

Blanche also addressed questions surrounding Gabbard’s presence during an FBI search of the Fulton County elections office in Georgia last week, saying he didn’t know why she was there. The search was related to an effort by the Justice Department to seize voting data and search for alleged fraud in the county, which has long been a centerpiece of Trump’s baseless claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him.

“I don’t know why the director was there. She is not part of the grand jury investigation,” Blanche said.

“But she is, for sure, a key part of our efforts at election integrity and making sure that we have free and fair elections,” he said. He emphasized that the investigation is being run by the FBI and cautioned against overstating Gabbard’s role.

CNN has reported that the move appears to provide an opportunity for Gabbard to curry favor with Trump by supporting his false but unrelenting claims about the 2020 election. Trump on Thursday night praised Gabbard for “working very hard to try to keep the election safe” when asked by CNN why she was present during the search.

The director of national intelligence oversees all foreign intelligence collection. Their traditional role in US elections is to protect them from foreign interference.

Blanche defended the Justice Department’s decision to bring charges against Lemon, countering criticism that the case amounts to criminalizing journalistic activity. Lemon and another independent journalist were arrested last week in connection with a protest at a church in St. Paul, Minnesota.

“There was absolutely probable cause that a crime had been committed,” Blanche said. “Our system doesn’t allow judges to make that decision … but only a grand jury can bring forth an indictment, and so that’s what we did.”

When asked whether Lemon’s actions could be seen as protected by the First Amendment, Blanche pointed to allegations that extend beyond ordinary journalistic activity.

“There are multiple allegations there, and guess what? He gets to have a lawyer, and he gets to have a defense. If he wants to go forward with the defense at ‘Aw, shucks, I was just a journalist,’ he can do that.”

He also rejected the notion that the case was politically motivated. “I don’t even know that the president’s even ever thought of Don Lemon. … We’re not making examples of people.”

Trump said Saturday he had no knowledge of Lemon’s arrest while launching personal attacks against the longtime journalist, calling him “a sleaze bag.”
