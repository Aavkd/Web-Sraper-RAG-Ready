## The Rust Programming Language

## The Rust Programming Language

*by Steve Klabnik, Carol Nichols, and Chris Krycho, with contributions from the Rust Community*

This version of the text assumes you’re using Rust 1.90.0 (released 2025-09-18) or later with `edition = "2024"` in the *Cargo.toml* file of all projects to configure them to use Rust 2024 Edition idioms. See the [“Installation” section of Chapter 1](https://doc.rust-lang.org/ch01-01-installation.html) for instructions on installing or updating Rust, and see [Appendix E](https://doc.rust-lang.org/appendix-05-editions.html) for information on editions.

The HTML format is available online at https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ and offline with installations of Rust made with `rustup`; run `rustup doc --book` to open.

Several community [translations](https://doc.rust-lang.org/appendix-06-translation.html) are also available.

This text is available in [paperback and ebook format from No Starch Press](https://nostarch.com/rust-programming-language-3rd-edition).
